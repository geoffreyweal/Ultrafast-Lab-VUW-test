We are wanting to find the transition state for a single mechanistic step. Visually, we are trying to find a 1st order saddlepoint to get from the reactant to the product on the potential energy surface (See image below). In this procedure/tutorial, we will look at how to obtain the transition state using ORCA.

    The x and y axis given as R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> in the image above just indicate there is a change in spatial coordinates of the atoms in your molecule going from the reactant to the product.
